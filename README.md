# project-1
Description:
Create a command-line based Todo List application using Python. This application will allow users to manage their tasks directly through the terminal/console. Tasks will be stored locally in a file and users can perform operations like adding tasks, marking tasks as complete, deleting tasks, and listing all tasks.

Features:

Add Task: Allow users to add new tasks with a title and optional description.
List Tasks: Display all tasks with their status (completed or pending).
Complete Task: Mark tasks as completed.
Delete Task: Remove tasks from the list.
Save and Load: Save tasks to a file so they persist between sessions and load them when the application starts.
